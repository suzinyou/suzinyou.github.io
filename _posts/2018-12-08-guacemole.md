# Guacamole

## Ingredients

* 1 Big Avocado
* 1/3 Big Tomato, diced
* 1/5 Red Onion, diced
** If it's too spicy, soak in water and drain before you mix it into the guacmole.
* 1/2 Lemon's juice
* 3 strands of cilantro, chopped, but don't include stems because they are too strong for me.
* Generous amount of salt and pepper

## Instructions

1. Cut avocado meat into a bowl.
2. Smash them to your liking.
3. Add in the rest of the ingredients and mix.

## Tips
Fried nacho chips are good.
